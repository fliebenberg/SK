# Application To-Do List

This list tracks the tasks we need to accomplish in your application.

## Pending Tasks

- [x] Automatically add the sport type to a team that is newly created when setting up a match.
- [x] Add delete button to match edit screen (only when match has already been saved and has not been played yet)
- [x] Only show match details under team events (include event name in the match details)
- [ ] Add the ability to make a copy of an event
- [ ] Prevent saving duplicate events (i.e. events that are exactly the same)
- [ ] Ability to select players for a match from the team view
- [ ] Consolidate Sportsday and Tournament view. Sportsday will just become one type of tournament. Based on the tournament type the details tab will change.
- [x] Add Offline indicator when the app is not connected to the server/websocket
- [ ] Implement robust email infrastructure:
    - Add email verification for new secondary email addresses.
    - Trigger Referral Scan/Notification Sync when a new email is verified.
    - Implement full password reset functionality (send reset codes to verified emails).
- [ ] Add ability to add a "Training" event type that can be scheduled to repeat
    - allow to add other teams to the same training event
    - can either add "all players" of selected teams or subset of players to attend the training (this then also allows for a roll call functionality)
- [ ] Add Venue Location (a group of Venues) e.g. "School Grounds" may have Field A, Field B and then "Sports Fields" might also have Field A, Field B
