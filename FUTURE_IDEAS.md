# Future Ideas

This document is a space to jot down brilliant ideas for the application while working on other tasks. You can refer to this list later to plan and prioritize new features.

## Ideas Bucket

- [ ] Add the ability to set up an ongoing "ladder" tournament where players can challenge each other to move up teh ladder. It could have rules like how many places above you you can challenge and how often a peson can be challenged (you dont want one player being challenged by several different players in a short period of time). It could facilitate the scheduling of matches etc.
- [ ] Add venue scheduling functionality to avoid multiple games being scheduled at the same venue at the same time. It could also allow for venues to be booked for private events etc.
