# Project File Mapping

When the user refers to the following terms, map them to these files in the project root:

- **"future ideas file"**: `[FUTURE_IDEAS.md](file:///c:/Fred/Coding/SK/FUTURE_IDEAS.md)`
- **"todo list"**: `[TODO.md](file:///c:/Fred/Coding/SK/TODO.md)`

Always write to or read from these specific files when the user uses these terms.
